      Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
      In the year of 2008 I started playing my first MMORPG Warhammer Online. The game made me fell in love with the PvP aspect of the game genre. After playing Warhammer Online and Rift for some time I joined the legendary RvR/open world PvP guild Red Guard in 2012 with which we dominated the World versus World in Guild Wars 2. With Red Guard we are now looking forward finding a new PvP driven MMORPG. We are currently helping to test Camelot Unchained which will
      <a href="http://massivelyop.com/2018/02/12/camelot-unchained-beta-fourth-of-july-mark-jacobs-interview/">launch its first beta stage (of three stages) on 4th July 2018.</a></p>

      Red Guard
      </h3>
      <p>
      <a href="http://rg.guildlaunch.com/"> Red Guard</a> is an old PvP driven EU guild originating from Dark Age of Camelot. The guild was taken over by Sacrx in Warhammer Online where they dominated on the Order side on the servers Karak-Eight Peaks and Karak-Norn. After a hiatus Red Guard came back strong in Guild Wars 2 reigning supreme in the World versus World environment beating every guild in a Guild versus Guild battle that dared to challenge us.

      Currently Playing
      </h3>
      <p>
      I'm currently playing on the Warhammer Online private server <a href="https://www.returnofreckoning.com/">Return of Reckoning</a>. My account name there is 'zumos2' and the guilds I'm playing in are Deep and Dry (Order) and Dark Omen (Destruction). Meanwhile I'm waiting for a new non-pay-to-win MMORPG with strong PvP. I'm pinning my hopes on Camelot Unchained whose President and Lead Designer is Mark Jacobs, designer of the RvR-centric MMORPGs Dark Age of Camelot and Warhammer Online.

    This video shows a massive clash of one of the best guilds at that time: KAZ Legacy.

    The best fights we had at that time during the game without a doubt was Za Drots. In the video you can see both some epic open world fights, as well as organised Guild vs Guild fights.

    I made this video to celebrate Sacrx being the first Ultimate Dominator with 250,000 open world kills. It shows some of Guild versus Guild fights we had including our voice communication!

    After about half a year when Red Guard quit Guild Wars 2 halfway in 2013, we came back at the start of 2014 to bomb once again!
